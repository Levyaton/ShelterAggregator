# Integrations Module

## Purpose

The Integrations module serves as the adapter layer between ShelterAggregator and the various Czech animal shelter data sources. Its responsibilities include:

- **Data Retrieval**: Connect to shelter-specific APIs or scrape public shelter websites to fetch raw animal listings.
- **Normalization**: Transform heterogeneous data formats into a common internal representation (DTO) for downstream processing.
- **Error Handling & Resilience**: Retry on transient failures, respect rate limits, and provide fallback behavior for unavailable sources.
- **Extensibility**: Enable new shelter integrations to be added by implementing a standard adapter interface without modifying core application logic.

This module ensures that the backend service always receives consistent, validated dog data regardless of the sourceâ€™s native format or availability.
